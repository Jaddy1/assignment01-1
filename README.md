**Old Fonts**

- 'Work Sans', sans-serif
- font-family: 'Neuton', serif;



**Changes Made**

- I changed the font of the body to Garamond serif then changed the line-height to 1.75em for the page to be more readable. 
  - From the older version of the site, the words were a lot closer together and compact which made it a little hard to read.
- I added padding to the bottom of the **h1**s  to leave more space between them and the content beneath it. Previously it was very close to the content but I added padding to make the page more readable and easier to differentiate the headings and the content below.
- I added letter spacing to the **li**s in the navigation to fill up more space and make it look  a little more clean and readable.
