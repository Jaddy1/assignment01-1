# Assignment 02

For this assignment, we were challenged with forking another student's repository and making some changes to their work. I made a couple of changes to the layout of the page.

- Navigation bar
  - Changed the font size so that the navigation bar took slightly less space. In the original version, it was quite large. I believe that this improved usability, as there is now more screen real-estate to read the content of the page.
  - Changed the color, as an embellishment. Used the same green as the city flag.
- Main Content
  - The original layout was very linear. I tried to make the page not as long by "staggering" the images next to their written content. I thought that this improved readability of the design.
  - The original layout had text over a dark gray background. I changed these backgrounds to white to improve legibility.
- Footer
  - In the original design, the reference links over the yellow button was rather difficult to read. I removed the yellow background, and turned it into a footer that took up the entire width of the page, with black, underlined links to the reference material. Overally, I think that this improved the overall legibility of the design.
